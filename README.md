# Steps to run
0. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and follow its instruction
1. Hit "Code" button at the top of this page, then copy the HTTPS link
2. Open the search bar, type "cmd" and hit enter
3. Now within the command prompt, type "git clone <link>" making sure to replace "<link>" with the link you copied from earlier
4. You have now cloned the project. Now run the command "cd ProjectAres". This should bring you into the new folder
5. Now run "./gradlew runClient". This will open a Minecraft instance with the mod and all dependencies installed. This may take a while the first time, as it must download all the dependencies, however each subsequent time will be much faster.
6. If your version is out of date, run the command "git pull" within the folder. This will update all relevant files, and you may repeat step 5 to run the client.
